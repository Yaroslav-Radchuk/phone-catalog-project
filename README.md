# React Phone catalog
In this application you can see phone catalog.

Here you can find a phone or tablet according to your parameters. There are also discounts and a price filter. You can save the most interesting for you in the basket, and then place an order.

I used these technologies: `React`, `TypeScript`, `React Hooks`, `React Router`, `Fetch`, `Promise`, `Bulma`, `SCSS`, `NPM`.
